# Phase 2 TRL4 - Task 2: Advanced Search Implementation - COMPLETED ✅

## Summary
Task 2 (Advanced Search & Query Builder) has been successfully implemented and integrated into the LabTrack application.

## Completed Features

### 1. Advanced Search Composable (`useAdvancedSearch.js`)
- ✅ Query building with multiple criteria and AND/OR logic
- ✅ 9 different search operators (contains, equals, starts with, ends with, greater than, less than, between, is empty, is not empty)
- ✅ Support for text, number, date, and select field types
- ✅ Regex mode for advanced text pattern matching
- ✅ Search persistence in localStorage
- ✅ Search history management (last 5 searches)
- ✅ Complex filter evaluation with proper type handling

### 2. Search Query Builder Component (`SearchQueryBuilder.vue`)
- ✅ Dynamic field selection (name, CAS number, synonyms, supplier, hazard class, location, quantity, etc.)
- ✅ Context-aware operator selection based on field type
- ✅ Value input validation and hints
- ✅ Add/remove conditions with proper UI feedback
- ✅ Simple/Advanced mode toggle
- ✅ Save search functionality with name input
- ✅ Clear all conditions feature

### 3. Saved Searches Component (`SavedSearches.vue`)
- ✅ Display saved searches with metadata (name, type, date)
- ✅ Load saved searches with one click
- ✅ Delete saved searches
- ✅ Show recent searches (last 5)
- ✅ Quick filter templates for common searches

### 4. Enhanced Compound Filters (`CompoundFilters.vue`)
- ✅ Backward compatible simple search mode
- ✅ Advanced search mode integration
- ✅ Quick filter buttons (Low Stock, Expiring Soon, Flammable, Corrosive)
- ✅ Collapsible saved searches panel
- ✅ Active filter count and clear functionality
- ✅ Regex toggle for simple text search

### 5. Integration with Compounds System
- ✅ Updated `useCompounds.js` to support advanced search composable
- ✅ Advanced search filtering takes precedence when active
- ✅ Fallback to simple filtering for backward compatibility
- ✅ Automatic pagination reset when filters change
- ✅ Proper state management with singleton pattern

### 6. Internationalization (i18n)
- ✅ Added search-related keys in EN, ES, PT languages
- ✅ Field labels, operators, UI text, and help messages
- ✅ Quick filter descriptions and error messages

## Technical Implementation

### Advanced Search Logic
- Supports complex queries with multiple conditions
- Proper type coercion for numeric and date comparisons
- Nested value access for compound object properties
- Regex support with error handling fallback
- AND/OR logic evaluation with proper precedence

### UI/UX Features
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Progressive disclosure (simple → advanced)
- Context-sensitive form inputs
- Clear visual feedback for active filters
- Accessible form controls and keyboard navigation

### Data Persistence
- Search queries saved to localStorage
- Automatic cleanup of old searches (20 max)
- Session state preservation across page reloads
- Search history tracking

## Integration Status
- ✅ Fully integrated with existing compound management system
- ✅ Backward compatible with existing simple search
- ✅ Seamless pagination integration
- ✅ Proper error handling and user feedback
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Next Steps
Task 2 is now complete and ready for testing. The system provides a powerful and user-friendly advanced search capability while maintaining full backward compatibility.
