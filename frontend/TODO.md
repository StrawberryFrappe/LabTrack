## üö® Critical TRL3 Implementation Priorities

### 1. **Compound Management CRUD Operations (Admin Only)** üéØ **TRL3 CRITICAL**
- [ ] Add compound form/modal with comprehensive validation (modal system needed)
- [ ] Edit compound functionality with optimistic updates
- [ ] Delete compound with confirmation dialog
- [ ] Basic search and filtering enhancement (current filters are foundation)
- [ ] Form validation system implementation

### 2. **Inventory Count System Completion** üéØ **TRL3 CRITICAL** 
- [ ] Complete count session workflow implementation
- [ ] Manual count entry interface (no barcode scanning for TRL3)
- [ ] Count discrepancy detection and reporting
- [ ] Count session persistence and management
- [ ] Basic count reports and summaries

### 3. **Data Import/Export for TRL3** üéØ **TRL3 ESSENTIAL**
- [ ] CSV import for compound data with validation
- [ ] CSV export for compounds and inventory data
- [ ] Excel format support (basic .xlsx read/write)
- [ ] Import template generation
- [ ] Data validation and conflict resolution

## üìã Core TRL3 Feature Implementation

### Essential UI Components for TRL3
- [ ] Modal/Dialog system for forms and confirmations 
- [ ] Toast notification system for user feedback
- [ ] Form validation framework with real-time feedback
- [ ] Confirmation dialogs for delete operations
- [ ] Loading states for all async operations

### Data Management (TRL3 Scope)
- [ ] Real backend API integration (replace mock data)
- [ ] Data persistence and synchronization
- [ ] Error handling for API failures
- [ ] Offline capability detection (basic)

## üîß Technical Debt & Modularization Priorities

### **CRITICAL - Code Organization Issues** üö® **GROWING TECHNICAL DEBT**

#### **Component Library Extraction** ‚ö†Ô∏è **URGENT MODULARIZATION NEEDED**
- [ ] **UI Component Library**: Extract reusable components to dedicated library structure
  - Move Button, Card, Input, Modal, etc. to `/src/components/ui/` with consistent APIs
  - Create component documentation and usage examples
  - Standardize props interfaces and event handling patterns
  - **Impact**: Currently scattered UI components make maintenance difficult

#### **Composables Refactoring** ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL FOR MAINTAINABILITY**
- [ ] **Split Large Composables**: `useCompounds.js` exceeding single responsibility
  - Create `useCompoundCRUD.js` for create/read/update/delete operations
  - Create `useCompoundFilters.js` for filtering and search logic
  - Create `useCompoundValidation.js` for form validation rules
  - **Current Issue**: 200+ lines in single composable, becoming hard to test and maintain

#### **Service Layer Cleanup** ‚ö†Ô∏è **API ARCHITECTURE DEBT**
- [ ] **Domain-Based Service Organization**: Group related API calls
  - Restructure from generic `api.js` to domain services (`compoundService.js`, `inventoryService.js`)
  - Implement consistent error handling patterns across all services
  - Create proper request/response interceptors for auth and error handling
  - **Problem**: Current API client is becoming monolithic and hard to extend

#### **Translation File Modularization** ‚ö†Ô∏è **I18N SCALING ISSUE**
- [ ] **Feature-Based Translation Structure**: Split monolithic language files
  - Move from `/src/locales/[lang].js` to `/src/locales/[lang]/[feature].js`
  - Create `/src/locales/[lang]/dashboard.js`, `/src/locales/[lang]/compounds.js`, etc.
  - Implement lazy loading for translation modules
  - **Current Problem**: Language files approaching 150+ lines, will become unwieldy

### **Performance & Architecture** ‚ö†Ô∏è **FUTURE SCALING CONCERNS**
- [ ] **State Management Strategy**: Evaluate Pinia implementation necessity (post-TRL3)
- [ ] **Component Lazy Loading**: Implement proper route-based code splitting
- [ ] **Bundle Optimization**: Analyze and optimize build output size
- [ ] **Caching Strategy**: Implement intelligent API response caching
## ‚ùå DEFERRED FEATURES (Post-TRL3)

### Removed from TRL3 Scope (Future Versions):
- ~~Advanced role-based access control~~ (Simple Admin/Visitor sufficient for TRL3)
- ~~User registration system~~ (3-user system, manual user creation)
- ~~Password reset functionality~~ (Admin managed)
- ~~Real-time collaboration~~ (Not needed for 3 users)
- ~~Advanced analytics and forecasting~~ (Basic reports sufficient)
- ~~Mobile PWA features~~ (Desktop web sufficient)
- ~~Barcode scanning~~ (Manual entry sufficient for TRL3)
- ~~Integration with external systems~~ (Standalone system)
- ~~Advanced security features~~ (Basic auth sufficient)
- ~~Dark mode/theming~~ (Single theme sufficient)
- ~~Performance optimization for large datasets~~ (Small dataset expected)
- ~~Advanced caching strategies~~ (Basic caching sufficient)
- ~~Service workers/offline support~~ (Online-only acceptable)
- ~~Push notifications~~ (Email notifications sufficient)
- ~~Email notifications~~ (In-app notifications sufficient)
- ~~Compliance and audit features~~ (Basic logging sufficient)
- ~~SDS management~~ (Out of scope)
- ~~Temperature monitoring~~ (Out of scope)
- ~~Supplier management~~ (Out of scope)
- ~~Purchase order tracking~~ (Out of scope)
- ~~Advanced location mapping~~ (Simple location strings sufficient)

### Simplified for TRL3:
- **Authentication**: 2-role system instead of complex RBAC
- **Reporting**: Basic CSV exports instead of advanced analytics
- **UI**: Functional design instead of highly polished UX
- **Search**: Enhanced filtering instead of full-text search
- **Import/Export**: CSV/Excel only instead of multiple formats
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly messages instead of comprehensive logging
