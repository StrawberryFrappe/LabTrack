## üö® CRITICAL TRL3 GAPS (Immediate Priority)

### **1. CRUD Operations Integration** üéØ **MOST CRITICAL** 
**Status**: Components exist but not connected
- [ ] **Add Compound Modal**: Connect CompoundForm.vue to BaseModal.vue
- [ ] **Edit Compound Workflow**: Implement edit compound functionality  
- [ ] **Delete Confirmation**: Use ConfirmDialog.vue for safe deletion
- [ ] **Form Validation**: Complete validation rules in CompoundForm.vue
- [ ] **CRUD Integration**: Connect forms to useCompounds.js methods
- [ ] **User Feedback**: Success/error notifications after operations

### **2. Inventory Count System** üéØ **CORE FEATURE**
**Status**: Infrastructure exists, workflow incomplete
- [ ] **Count Session Management**: Complete count workflow implementation
- [ ] **Manual Count Entry**: Finish CountEntryModal.vue component
- [ ] **Count Persistence**: Connect to useInventoryCount.js composable
- [ ] **Discrepancy Detection**: Implement variance calculation and reporting
- [ ] **Session History**: Display and manage completed counts

### **3. Data Import/Export** üéØ **TRL3 ESSENTIAL**
**Status**: Mentioned in utils but not implemented
- [ ] **CSV Import**: Implement compound data import with validation
- [ ] **CSV Export**: Export compounds and inventory data
- [ ] **Excel Support**: Basic .xlsx read/write using existing xlsx package
- [ ] **Import Templates**: Generate downloadable import templates
- [ ] **Data Validation**: Import conflict resolution and error handling

### **4. User Feedback System** üéØ **UX CRITICAL**
**Status**: Error handling exists but no notifications
- [ ] **Toast Notifications**: Success/error feedback for all operations
- [ ] **Loading Indicators**: Global loading states for API operations
- [ ] **Error Recovery**: Retry mechanisms and graceful error handling
- [ ] **Confirmation Dialogs**: Connect existing ConfirmDialog to workflows

## üìã TRL3 Feature Completion (Secondary Priority)

### **Enhanced UI/UX** 
- [ ] **Dashboard Widgets**: Complete low stock and expiring items actions
- [ ] **Search Enhancement**: Improve compound search with better filters
- [ ] **Pagination**: Handle large compound lists efficiently
- [ ] **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Power user productivity features

### **Reports & Analytics**
- [ ] **Basic Reports**: Current stock, low stock, expiring items
- [ ] **Count Reports**: Inventory count summaries and discrepancies
- [ ] **Export Reports**: PDF/Excel export for audit purposes

## üîß Technical Debt Assessment (Realistic Priority)

### **LOW PRIORITY - Code is Well-Organized** ‚úÖ **NOT URGENT**

> **Note**: Previous TODO claimed "growing technical debt" but code review shows good architecture:

#### **Component Organization** ‚úÖ **ALREADY DONE**
- [x] UI components **already extracted** to `/src/components/ui/` 
- [x] Consistent props interfaces and event handling
- [x] Good separation of concerns across components

#### **Composables Structure** ‚úÖ **WELL-STRUCTURED**  
- [x] useCompounds.js is 263 lines but **well-organized and readable**
- [x] Single responsibility principle maintained
- [x] Clear method separation for CRUD operations
- [x] **No urgent need to split** - current structure is maintainable

#### **Translation Architecture** ‚úÖ **ALREADY MODULARIZED**
- [x] Feature-based structure **already implemented**: `/src/locales/[lang]/[feature].js`
- [x] Good separation: dashboard.js, compounds.js, inventory.js, etc.
- [x] **No further modularization needed** at current scale

#### **Service Layer** ‚úÖ **APPROPRIATE FOR SCALE**
- [x] Domain-based services already implemented (compoundService, authService)
- [x] Consistent error handling patterns
- [x] **Current architecture suitable** for TRL3 requirements

### **Future Optimization (Post-TRL3)** üîÑ **DEFERRED**
- [ ] **State Management**: Consider Pinia if app grows beyond current scope
- [ ] **Code Splitting**: Route-based lazy loading for performance
- [ ] **Bundle Optimization**: Analyze build output if needed
- [ ] **Advanced Caching**: API response caching for larger datasets
## ‚ùå FEATURES DEFERRED TO POST-TRL3

### Removed from TRL3 Scope (Future Versions):
- ~~Advanced role-based access control~~ (Simple Admin/Visitor sufficient for TRL3)
- ~~User registration system~~ (3-user system, manual user creation)  
- ~~Password reset functionality~~ (Admin managed)
- ~~Real-time collaboration~~ (Not needed for 3 users)
- ~~Advanced analytics and forecasting~~ (Basic reports sufficient)
- ~~Mobile PWA features~~ (Desktop web sufficient)
- ~~Barcode scanning~~ (Manual entry sufficient for TRL3)
- ~~Integration with external systems~~ (Standalone system)
- ~~Advanced security features~~ (Basic auth sufficient)
- ~~Dark mode/theming~~ (Single theme sufficient)
- ~~Performance optimization for large datasets~~ (Small dataset expected)
- ~~Advanced caching strategies~~ (Basic caching sufficient)
- ~~Service workers/offline support~~ (Online-only acceptable)
- ~~Push notifications~~ (Email notifications sufficient)
- ~~Email notifications~~ (In-app notifications sufficient)
- ~~Compliance and audit features~~ (Basic logging sufficient)
- ~~SDS management~~ (Out of scope)
- ~~Temperature monitoring~~ (Out of scope)
- ~~Supplier management~~ (Out of scope)
- ~~Purchase order tracking~~ (Out of scope)
- ~~Advanced location mapping~~ (Simple location strings sufficient)

### Simplified for TRL3:
- **Authentication**: 2-role system instead of complex RBAC
- **Reporting**: Basic CSV exports instead of advanced analytics
- **UI**: Functional design instead of highly polished UX
- **Search**: Enhanced filtering instead of full-text search
- **Import/Export**: CSV/Excel only instead of multiple formats
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly messages instead of comprehensive logging
