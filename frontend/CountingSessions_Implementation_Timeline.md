## Integration Architecture

### Component Communication Flow
```
AuditView.vue (orchestrator)
    ├── CountSession.vue (display)
    │   └── Actions → CountEntryModal.vue
    │
    ├── CountEntryModal.vue (counting interface)
    │   ├── InstanceSelector.vue (finding)
    │   ├── InstanceFormModal.vue (creation)
    │   └── Verification Controls
    │
    └── useInventoryCount.js (state management)
        ├── Session CRUD
        ├── Progress tracking
        ├── Instance verification
        └── inventoryCountService.js (API)
```

### State Management Strategy
```javascript
// useInventoryCount.js central state:
{
  sessions: Map<id, Session>,
  currentSession: Session | null,
  currentLocation: string | null,
  verifiedInstances: Set<instanceId>,
  discrepancies: Map<instanceId, Discrepancy>,
  newInstances: Set<instanceId>,
  movedInstances: Map<instanceId, Movement>
}
```

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **State Synchronization**
   - Risk: Counting progress lost on navigation
   - Mitigation: Auto-save every 30 seconds, localStorage backup

2. **Performance with Large Inventories**
   - Risk: UI lag with 1000+ instances
   - Mitigation: Virtual scrolling, pagination, lazy loading

3. **Concurrent Counting Sessions**
   - Risk: Data conflicts between users
   - Mitigation: Session locking, real-time sync warnings

### Medium-Risk Areas
1. **Integration Complexity**
   - Risk: Existing components may need modifications
   - Mitigation: Careful testing at each integration point

2. **Data Migration**
   - Risk: Existing data incompatible with new structure
   - Mitigation: Migration scripts, backwards compatibility

## Success Criteria

### Phase-Level Success Metrics
- **Phase 1**: 90% test coverage on core functions
- **Phase 2**: Session display renders in <100ms
- **Phase 3**: Can count 100 instances in <5 minutes
- **Phase 4**: Integration adds <2 seconds overhead
- **Phase 5**: Reports generate in <3 seconds

### Overall Feature Success ✅ ALL CRITERIA MET

## Coding Agent Instructions

### Initial Setup
1. **Read these files first**:
   - `src/views/AuditView.vue` - Current implementation
   - `src/composables/useInventoryCount.js` - State management
   - `src/components/inventory/CountSession.vue` - Component structure
   - `db.json` - Data structure reference

2. **Verify dependencies**:
   - Vue 3 Composition API patterns
   - Tailwind CSS classes available
   - i18n translation keys structure
   - Existing instance/compound composables

### Implementation Guidelines

#### Code Style Requirements
```vue
<!-- Component template -->
<template>
  <div class="space-y-4"> <!-- Tailwind spacing -->
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">
      {{ t('inventory.sessionTitle') }} <!-- Always use i18n -->
    </h2>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref, computed } from 'vue'
import { useI18n } from 'vue-i18n'
import { useInventoryCount } from '@/composables/useInventoryCount'

const { t } = useI18n()
const { sessions, createSession } = useInventoryCount()

// Reactive state
const isLoading = ref(false)
const error = ref(null)

// Computed properties for derived state
const activeSessions = computed(() => 
  sessions.value.filter(s => s.status === 'active')
)
</script>
```

#### Error Handling Pattern
```javascript
const handleAction = async () => {
  isLoading.value = true
  error.value = null
  
  try {
    await performAction()
    success(t('inventory.actionSuccess'))
  } catch (err) {
    error.value = err.message
    error(t('inventory.actionError'))
  } finally {
    isLoading.value = false
  }
}
```

### Testing Strategy

#### Component Testing Checklist
1. **Isolation**: Test each component independently first
2. **Integration**: Test component connections
3. **State**: Verify state updates correctly
4. **UI**: Check all user interactions
5. **Edge Cases**: Empty states, errors, large datasets

#### Manual Testing Scenarios
1. Create session with 1, 5, 10 locations
2. Count 10, 100, 1000 instances
3. Handle network failures gracefully
4. Test on tablet-sized screens
5. Verify i18n in all languages

### Validation Checkpoints

#### After Each Phase
1. Run `npm run dev` and test all features
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify data persistence in db.json
4. Test responsive design at 768px, 1024px, 1440px
5. Validate all i18n keys are defined

#### Integration Testing
1. Create session → Count instances → Complete
2. Find misplaced item → Update location
3. Create new instance → Verify in count
4. Generate report → Verify accuracy
5. Complete session → Check inventory updates
