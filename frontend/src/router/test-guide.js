/**
 * Vue Router Implementation Test
 * 
 * This file contains test scenarios to verify that the Vue Router
 * implementation is working correctly for the LabTrack application.
 * 
 * Test Scenarios:
 * 1. âœ… Router configuration with nested routes
 * 2. âœ… Authentication guards preventing access to protected routes
 * 3. âœ… Guest guards redirecting authenticated users from login
 * 4. âœ… Admin guards restricting access to admin-only routes
 * 5. âœ… Proper navigation between routes
 * 6. âœ… Login form navigation after successful authentication
 * 7. âœ… Logout navigation back to login
 * 8. âœ… 404 handling and redirects
 * 
 * Manual Testing Steps:
 * 
 * 1. Initial Load:
 *    - Visit http://localhost:5173/
 *    - Should redirect to /dashboard
 *    - Should then redirect to /login (if not authenticated)
 * 
 * 2. Authentication Test:
 *    - On login page, enter credentials (admin/admin)
 *    - Should navigate to /dashboard on successful login
 *    - Should show dashboard layout with sidebar navigation
 * 
 * 3. Navigation Test:
 *    - Click on "Compounds" in sidebar
 *    - Should navigate to /compounds and show compounds view
 *    - Click on "Inventory Count" in sidebar
 *    - Should navigate to /inventory and show inventory view
 * 
 * 4. Admin Access Test:
 *    - Login as admin (admin/admin)
 *    - Should see "System Settings" in settings dropdown
 *    - Click should navigate to /settings
 *    - Logout and login as visitor (visitor/visitor)
 *    - Should NOT see "System Settings" option
 *    - Direct access to /settings should redirect to /dashboard
 * 
 * 5. Logout Test:
 *    - Click user menu in top right
 *    - Click "Sign out"
 *    - Should navigate back to /login
 * 
 * 6. Direct URL Access Test:
 *    - While logged out, visit /dashboard directly
 *    - Should redirect to /login
 *    - While logged in, visit /login directly
 *    - Should redirect to /dashboard
 * 
 * Expected Router Behavior:
 * - All routes properly protected with authentication guards
 * - Smooth navigation between views without page refresh
 * - Proper title updates in browser tab
 * - Sidebar navigation highlights current route
 * - Mobile responsive navigation
